# Employee attrition rate data analysis and visualization

This is a data analysis and visualization project that I created to showcase my skills in this field. Using Jupyter Notebook and various Python libraries, I analyzed a dataset of employee attrition rate and visualized the results using tables and various different types of charts and plots. Through this project, I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in data cleaning, data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I also gained experience in using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform data analysis and create visualizations. This project highlights my ability to work independently and to apply my analytical skills to real-world data. I am excited to continue developing my skills in data analysis and visualization and to contribute to the success of a team.

### Aim of the project
- To determine if there are patterns and trends that can be spotted to predict which factors lead to an employee leaving the company. Such analysis can help companies decide on a sustainable strategy to retain their employees.

### Questions to be answered about the dataset

- Age based analysis
    - What does the age based distribution of the employees working at this company look like?
    - By seperating the employees into different age groups: How much percentage of the employees belong to which age range and do they still work at the company or not?
    - How many jobs have the employees had based on their age group and do they still work at this company?
- Department based analysis
    - What is the average monthly income based on the departments
    - Which department has the highest and lowest attrition rates?
    - What is the relationship between work environment satisfaction, job satisfaction, work/life balance and the different departments
- Distance based analysis
    - What is the relationship between distance from home and the job satisfaction of the employees?
    - How does distance from home affect the attrition rate?
- Education based analysis
    - Does the education level of the employee influence their monthly income?
    - What is the relationship between attrition rates and education level of the employees?
- Income based analysis
    - Is the employee's salary influencing their job satisfaction?
    - Does the monthly income of the employees suggest any patterns in terms of them staying at the company or leaving?
